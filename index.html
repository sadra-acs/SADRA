		<h2><a title="Abstract="#">Abstract</a></h2>
		<p>Resource disaggregation decouples compute, memory, storage, and accelerators into independently managed resource pools—improving elasticity and utilization in modern cloud, HPC, and distributed systems. However, it also breaks traditional access control assumptions: processes now access remote resources across untrusted nodes, often bypassing host kernels and centralized policy enforcement. Existing access control systems fail to meet the demands of such settings, especially under multi-tenancy, hardware-only data paths, and decentralized infrastructure.</p>

		<p>We present <strong>SADRA</strong>, a sound, fully distributed capability-based access control system designed for resource-disaggregated architectures. SADRA is the first system, to our knowledge, to fully support all six essential characteristics required for secure access control in these environments: distributed enforcement, subject and object granularity, capability delegation and revocation, and capability persistency. It achieves scalable, low-latency enforcement through a novel two-stage model offloaded to SmartNICs at both compute and resource nodes—eliminating reliance on trusted host software and enabling hardware-only policy checks.</p>

		<p>We formally prove that SADRA satisfies capability safety, authority safety, and strong isolation using the Assumption–Commitment method, and verify these guarantees via SPIN model checking. We implement SADRA on FPGA-based SmartNICs in a memory-disaggregated system and evaluate its performance under realistic read, write, and revocation workloads.</p>

		<p>Our results show that SADRA incurs negligible overhead—averaging 0.26% and peaking at 0.36%—while enabling secure, fine-grained, and revocable access control entirely in hardware across untrusted, multi-tenant deployments.
