		<p>Disaggregated-resource architectures address growing resource and scalability demands from distributed computing systems in the big-data era. However, the distributed nature of shared resources in disaggregated-resource architectures makes controlling access to resources challenging. Recent works showed that access control based on capabilities suits these architectures better.</p> 

<p>In this paper, we reviewed the existing capability systems and extracted a minimum set of criteria that an access control system should satisfy to suit a distributed architecture. We concluded that none of the existing approaches meet all these criteria. Therefore to address their shortcomings, we propose a general-purpose capability-based access-control system, SADRA. We formally prove that SADRA's approach is sound; in particular, we prove that it is capability and authority safe. In addition, we show that SADRA can provably isolate resources of processes, thus protecting them from illegal accesses. To show that disaggregated-resource architecture can benefit from our access control system, we apply SADRA to  Memory-Driven Computing as a case study. Finally, we mechanized our approach's soundness by modeling and verifying it using the SPIN model checker.</p>
